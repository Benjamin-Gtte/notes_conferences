Title: Haar measure in Solid Mechanics
---
How to integrate over a group? 
- if we take a finite group, the integral is the sum over each element, and we have to choose the weights of each component.
What about the group of 3D rotations? In mechanics, we have several possible parametrisation. 

**Bibliography**
- $\mu_G$ is the Haar measure of a compact Lie group, necessary as soon as we need to integrate on a group.
**Group integration**
- a lie group is a manifold with a differentiable group structure. In a lie group, multiplication and inversion are differentiable. The lie algebra is the tangent space to the identity. For the rotation group, the lie algebra is the orthogonal matrices. 
- In the case of compact Lie group, there exists a unique, bi-invariant Haar mesure, bi-invariant.
- Now, we want to express the Haar measure in a system of coordinates. 
- **Main result**: general expression of the Haar mesure in a system of coordinates
**Examples**
- rotation of the plane : find back the usual formula
- rotations in SO(3): Euler angles
- group of unitary quaternions
- Open problem: is there a possibility to make the weight coefficient of the Haar measure equal to one, or at least constant ? 
**Reynolds projector** 2 important properties :
- it is a projector
- it creates invariants. 

**conclusion**
- The haar measure is the basic ingredient for integrating over a Lie group
- It allows to formulation the Reynolds projector
