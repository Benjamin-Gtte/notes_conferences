Title: On maximal totally real embeddings
---
- Holomorphic functions: derivable in the sense of complex numbers/$\mathbb{C}$-differentiable
- Involutive
- Complex manifold
- Theorem of Bruhat-Whitney: you have a real manifold. Take two complex submanifold of the manifold. Then, the objective is to make calculus between these two complex submanifolds. (pas certain de mon coup)
